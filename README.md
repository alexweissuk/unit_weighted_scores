# unit_weighted_scores
Helper for R that generates unit-weighted factor scores

This code can be used to create unit-weighted factor scores, which I use in a lot of my analyses. 

I designed this to work with factor loading matrices generated by the fa and principal functions from Bill Revelle's psych package.

Unit-weighted scoring is sometimes preferred when sample sizes are small and factor or component loadings are not as stable. Gorsuch (1983) reported that unit-weighted scores fared well compared to 'exact' scores.
Wainer (1976) reported the same in the case of regression. Grice (2001) referred to this method as a "simplified ("coarse") weighting process" (p. 433).

The function allows the user to change the cut-point for salience (usually .3 or .4) and to set the precision of the cut-point (rounded to two decimal places, etc.)
